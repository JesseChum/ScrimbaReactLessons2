1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
Returns a new array. whatever gets return from the callback function
provided is placed at the same index in that new array.


2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
convert an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements
that can be displayed on page


3. Critical thinking: why is using `.map()` better than just
   creating the components manually by typing them out?
we often dont have the data ahead of time whe were building
the app, we cant type everything out

Our code will be "self-sustaining". So not requiring any additional changes
